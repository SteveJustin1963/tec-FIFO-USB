## Example 1

"OK, a bit premature but had to share that my PCBs are on their way.
Wire wrap of a USB port onto a Z-80 worked well hope the PCB works too.

plugs into CPU socket, so it is a Z-80 with a USB port, it is basically a memory mapped FIFO. Mini USB connectors have not arrived yet, tried a micro but does not quite fit. 

What compiler are u using ? and what is under the z80 with usb? thanks. I used SDCC, I have a USB FIFO to load the program in.

These are early versions so not all the bells and whistles that are possible but enough to be fun.
