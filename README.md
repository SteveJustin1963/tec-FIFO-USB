# tec-FIFO-USB



## Andrew McMeikan 
is working on a project to wire a USB port onto a Z-80 microprocessor. He mentions that the design uses a FIFO buffer, which is a type of data structure that temporarily stores data before it is sent to the host or device, allowing for a more efficient transfer of data. He is using the SDCC compiler and has a USB FIFO in place to load programs. He also mentioned that the Mini USB connectors have not arrived yet, and he had tried a micro but it did not quite fit. It seems like these are early versions of the project, and not all the features are implemented yet but it is enough to be fun.
